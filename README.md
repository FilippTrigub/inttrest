# Inttrest: AI-Powered Location Discovery Map

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Inttrest is an interactive, interest-based location discovery application. It combines a beautiful 3D map interface with a powerful AI chat assistant that can use external tools to find and display points of interest in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Chat:** Converse with an intelligent assistant to find restaurants, parks, museums, and more.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Tool Use:** The AI leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to dynamically use external APIs for web scraping (Apify) and advanced search (Exa).
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive 3D Map:** Explore locations on a stunning 3D map powered by Mapbox, complete with terrain visualization.
- **‚ö° Unified Tool Backend:** A central Python server aggregates multiple MCP-compatible tools, providing a single, consistent endpoint for the AI.
- **üöÄ Modern Frontend:** Built with the latest web technologies, including Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS, all optimized with Turbopack.
- **üîå Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new data sources and tools to the MCP server to expand the assistant's capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with a backend tool server via an API route. The AI model acts as a reasoning engine, deciding when to call external tools to fulfill a user's request.

    C -.->|"(5) Result to LLM via API Route"| B
    B -.->|"(6) Streams final AI response to UI"| A
```

**Flow Explanation:**
1.  A user sends a message from the **Next.js Frontend**.
2.  The request hits the `/api/chat` route, which connects to the local **Python MCP Server** to discover available tools (e.g., `exa.search`).
3.  The prompt and the list of tools are sent to an **OpenAI model**.
4.  If the model decides to use a tool, the AI SDK executes it by calling the Python MCP Server, which **proxies the request** to the appropriate external API (like Exa or Apify).
5.  The tool result is sent back to the model, which formulates a final answer.
6.  The response is streamed back to the user interface, and any discovered location data is used to update the map.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.12, as specified in `.python-version`)
- `npm` or a compatible package manager
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI
  - Mapbox
  - Apify
  - Exa

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inttrest.git
cd inttrest
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (MCP Server)

The unified server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and provides tools to the frontend.

```bash
# Navigate to the mcp_servers directory
cd mcp_servers

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# Create an environment file (if you don't have one)
touch .env
```

Now, add your API keys to the `.env` file:

**`mcp_servers/.env`**
```
APIFY_API_TOKEN="your_apify_api_token"
EXA_API_KEY="your_exa_api_key"
```

Finally, start the server in a dedicated terminal window:

```bash
python unified_server.py
```
You should see output indicating the server has started successfully.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal window for these steps.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Create a local environment file
touch .env.local
```

Now, add your API keys to the `.env.local` file:

**`frontend/.env.local`**
```
# Get this from your Mapbox account
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="pk.your_mapbox_public_access_token"

# Get this from your OpenAI account
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_openai_api_key"

# Optional: Specify a different OpenAI model
# OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
```

### 4. Run the Application

With the backend server still running in the first terminal, start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
