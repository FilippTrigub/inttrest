# ADR-001: MCP Protocol Choice for Event Discovery Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to create a server that integrates Meetup.com's event discovery APIs with Anthropic's Claude LLM to provide intelligent event recommendations. The system needs to:

1. Accept natural language queries from users
2. Extract relevant parameters (location, time, topics)
3. Query Meetup.com APIs for relevant events
4. Augment user prompts with event data
5. Generate AI-powered recommendations via Claude
6. Provide a standardized interface for client applications

## Decision
We will implement this as a Model Communication Protocol (MCP) server rather than a traditional REST API or CLI tool.

## Rationale

### Advantages of MCP:

1. **Standardized Protocol**: MCP provides a well-defined protocol for tool and resource discovery, making integration with Claude and other AI systems seamless.

2. **Tool-based Architecture**: The MCP tool model naturally fits our use case where we have distinct operations (search events, augment prompts, get recommendations).

3. **Resource Management**: MCP's resource system allows us to expose configuration and status information in a structured way.

4. **Future-proof**: As AI systems increasingly adopt MCP, our server will be compatible with a growing ecosystem.

5. **Type Safety**: MCP's schema-based tool definitions provide clear contracts and validation.

### Alternatives Considered:

1. **REST API**: Would require custom client implementations and doesn't integrate as naturally with LLM workflows.

2. **CLI Tool**: Limited to command-line usage and harder to integrate with web applications or other systems.

3. **Python Library**: Would require users to write Python code and wouldn't provide language-agnostic access.

4. **GraphQL API**: More complex to implement and doesn't provide the tool-oriented interface that fits our use case.

## Implementation Details

### MCP Tools Provided:
- `search_meetup_events`: Direct event search functionality
- `augment_prompt_with_events`: Context enhancement for existing prompts
- `get_event_recommendations`: Full AI-powered recommendation pipeline
- `get_oauth_url`: Authentication setup assistance

### MCP Resources Provided:
- `meetup://config`: Server configuration and status
- `meetup://auth/status`: Authentication status information

### Protocol Benefits:
- Automatic tool discovery by MCP clients
- Schema validation for all tool inputs
- Structured error handling and reporting
- Standardized resource access patterns

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Easy integration with Claude and other MCP-compatible systems
- Clear separation of concerns between tools
- Standardized interface reduces integration complexity
- Future compatibility with expanding MCP ecosystem

### Negative:
- Requires MCP client for access (not directly HTTP accessible)
- Additional learning curve for developers unfamiliar with MCP
- Dependency on MCP protocol stability and adoption

### Mitigation:
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Design internal architecture to be protocol-agnostic (easy to add REST endpoints later if needed)
- Use stable MCP libraries and follow protocol best practices

## Monitoring
- Track MCP tool usage patterns
- Monitor protocol performance and error rates
- Evaluate client feedback on MCP integration experience
- Assess need for additional protocol support based on usage
